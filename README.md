# Basic-R
A one script introduction to R from scratch.  If you want to jump to the punch line, load the script and render it as html (see directions near the bottom).  Otherwise run each code line interactivly by placing your curson on the line and typing in ctl-enter (command-return on a Mac).  Have fun!
